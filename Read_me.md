This wordpress plugin is to avoid toxic comments using perspective api

to use it
First install it and then go to your wordpress dashboard and in the settings tab you'll get sub menu which is called "AI Moderation Setting"
then click the link and it'll prompt you to enter your perspective api link. you can see here - https://support.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started
then after you get your api key, enter in the input field of the setting. then test it by creating a post and then comment some toxic comments and positive comments. then if the toxic level of the comment is above 0.7, it'll not displayed in the comment section.

Thank you.
